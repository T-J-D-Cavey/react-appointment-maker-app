# React appointment-maker app #

This app is a challenge project by Codecademy.

It's a react app, that allows the user to create a list of contacts, and create appointments with selected contacts. 

It utilises react-router-dom v5.2 and function components. 

## Why have I made this app? ##

This project is part of Codecademy's 'Front end developer' and React course. 

It's one of the final steps in the React course, to reinforce the learnings from the course which covered concepts such as:

- components (class and functions)
- state
- life cycle methods and hooks
- routing and generalised components

## Is this project available online? ##

This will be available via a Netlify domain. Link tbc
